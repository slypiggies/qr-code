There is a large setup violation of -2.758 ns between ENABLE_PROCESSING_if.sobel_i/kernel3_controller_i/state_2_reg[2]/C (clocked by CLK100) and ENABLE_PROCESSING_if.frame_buffer_y_i/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[22].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ENBWREN (clocked by CLK100). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
